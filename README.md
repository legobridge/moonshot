# Catnap
A simple Unity game about a sleepy cat.


## About the Game

You're a very sleepy cat that wants to reach the cozy pillow and fall asleep. But you're also craving pets and belly rubs from all the humans around, and you can't fall asleep before you've had your fill of those. 

## Goal

Get pets from all the humans in the level and land on top of the pillow before you run out of time. The humans try to run away when you get near, because they have committment issues and don't want to get too attached to someone else's pet. After petting you, they get transported to an alternate dimension of pure bliss.

## Other Notes

If you're having trouble jumping make sure you're not right up against a vertical wall, the friction inhibits jumps and I haven't fixed that yet.
