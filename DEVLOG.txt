I've decided to call this new game "Moonshot". Why? I'll figure it out, but I'm guessing it will have moon(s) and shooting in it.


Aesthetic Goals:

1. The player should have limited attempts to achieve the goal(s) of the game, and should feel the pressure to get it right in as few attempts as possible.
   This goal will require the game to balance the difficulty of each attempt so that it's possible to fail but not impossible to win.
   If the player is winning more often than losing, it is a good sign.
   If the player is losing at least 50% of the time, or winning 100% of the time, it is a bad sign.

2. There should be a sense of pride and accomplishment in the player once they eventually succeed (they should feel cool for having won).
   If the game takes some time to figure out, but the solution appears clever once it's figured out, this goal is successful.
   If the solution is too obvious and the game is too easy to win, this goal has failed.


Core Loop:

The player controls a bunch of scientists on Earth trying to successfully land a rocket on any one of Jupiter's moons. 
Our own moon, Mars, the asteroid belt, and Jupiter are the major obstacles in our way.
The scientists know their aim sucks, so they built three rockets. 
The game loop is to move the Earth to the ideal point in its orbit, then aim and fire a rocket until the player succeeds or runs out of rockets.
The limit of 3 rockets serves the first aesthetic goal. 
The ideal position of Earth relative to the other heavenly bodies is not obvious, and neither is the aiming of the rocket. This serves the second goal.

Started work on laying out the planets in Unity and immediately ran into several questions about scale. Trying to use the actual scale of distances would make the game (a) look weird, (b) not fit on a single screen (and I don't want to make players scroll), and (c) very hard and not fun at all. The actual scale of sizes of the planets would also cause similar problems. 

So, I've decided to prioritize the aesthetic goals over realism, and will simply pick whatever sizes and distances make the game fun (Outer Wilds did something similar, with great success).
